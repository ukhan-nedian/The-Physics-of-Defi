## 🔍 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

### What is Decentralized Finance (DeFi)?
DeFi refers to financial services that operate on blockchain technology without central authorities. It allows for peer-to-peer transactions and often includes lending, trading, and investing.

### What does "systemic risk" mean in the context of DeFi?
Systemic risk in DeFi arises when a disruption in one part of the system can lead to widespread negative effects throughout the entire ecosystem. Our application helps to identify and model these risks.

### Can I use the application without prior knowledge of finance?
Yes, this application is designed to be intuitive. It walks you through complex concepts in a simple manner.

### Is there a community or support for users?
Yes, you can join our community on forums and social media. Visit our GitHub discussions for support and to connect with other users.
